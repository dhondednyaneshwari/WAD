<h2>Web Application</h2>
<p>A Web application (Web app) is an application program that is stored on a 
remote server and delivered over the Internet through a browser interface. Web services 
are Web apps by definition and many, although not all, websites contain Web apps. 
According to Web.AppStorm editor Jarel Remick, any website component that performs some 
function for the user qualifies as a Web app.</p>
<p>Web applications can be designed for a wide variety of uses and can be used by 
anyone; from an organization to an individual for numerous reasons. Commonly used Web 
applications can include webmail, online calculators, or e-commerce shops. Some Web apps 
can be only accessed by a specific browser; however, most are available no matter the 
browser.</p>
<p>For a web app to operate, it needs a Web server, application server, and a 
database. Web servers manage the requests that come from a client, while the application 
server completes the requested task. A database can be used to store any needed 
information.</p

<h1>React JS</h1>

<div data-role="content" data-theme="a">
<h2>Declarative</h2>
<p>React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each 
state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right 
components when your data changes</p>
<p>Declarative views make your code more predictable and easier to debug.</p>
<h2>Component-Based</h2>
<p>Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to 
make complex UIs.</p>
<p>Since component logic is written in JavaScript instead of templates, you can 
easily pass rich data through your app and keep state out of the DOM</p>
<h2>Learn Once, Write Anywhere</h2>
<p>We donâ€™t make assumptions about the rest of your technology stack, so you can 
develop new features in React without rewriting existing code.</p>
<p>React can also render on the server using Node and power mobile apps using 
React Native.</p>

<h3>Full-Stack Framework</h3>
<p>Rails is a full-stack framework. It ships with all the tools needed to build 
amazing web apps on both the front and back end.</p>
<p>Rendering HTML templates, updating databases, sending and receiving emails, 
maintaining live pages via WebSockets, enqueuing jobs for asynchronous work, storing 
uploads in the cloud, providing solid security protections for common attacks. Rails does 
it all and so much more.</p>
<p>Rails has united and cultivated a strong tribe around a wide set of heretical 
thoughts about the nature of programming and programmers. Understanding these thoughts 
will help you understand the design of the framework.</p>
